    Also, enumerate all suggestions on how to address these vulnerabilities, 
    give both a detailed explanation, easy to understand, of what the exposure is in that case, and also provide a code example on how to fix it based on the contract provided.
    Give just the code they need to add or subtract, and mention the number of the line as a reference, if applicable. 
    Use this format for the output: 
    Vulnerabilities: (make this bold)

    1. 'state the vunerability 1'

    2. 'state the vunerability 2'

    3. '...'

    Example:
    'reference number of line for the vulnerability 1'
    'the code example'

    'reference number of line for the vulnerability 2'
